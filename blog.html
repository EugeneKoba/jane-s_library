                            <p class="para-one">Literature does exist today, very much so. Finding great literature is a lot like finding great music. You have to actively seek it out -- find sources you trust and follow them. You can't wait for the entertainment industry to dole stuff directly to you, otherwise you'll end up reading the literary equivalent of Katy Perry. Who knows about the stigma of the Oprah O and what that even means. If you avoided that, you'd avoid one of the best novels of the past few years, Jonathan Franzen's Freedom.  Franzen actually denied the O the first time around because of exactly what you're saying. Eventually he caved.</p>
                            <h3 class="sub-heading pt-3">So What Is The State Of Literature Now?</h3>
                            <p class="pt-2">This is a good question. The current state of literatire is very transfigured. I do not see her book club choices as fluff at all. In fact, her novels oftentimes are a little too intense for readers.</p>
                            <p>My reading life was irrevocably changed when I worked at that crazy bookstore downtown for so many years. So in a way, I'm ruined for normal life. I read things I accumulated then, supplemented by books I find recommended on a sub-reddit, or metafilter, or newspaper reviews I find connected to something I've found interesting. Wandering through the library has led me to a few things, too. Though I savor books too long to do well with libraries; I feel rushed when I borrow a book.</p>
                            <div>
                                <p class="text-center mt-5 mb-1"><b>"The future is not something we enter, it is something we create"</b></p>
                                <p class="text-center mt-1 mb-5"><i>~ Leonard I. Sweet</i></p>
                            </div>
                            <p>In terms of finding good books, I'd check out the DNT's Sunday bestsellers list, which they get from the Midwest Booksellers Association and the Great Lakes Booksellers Association; both are organizations of independent booksellers in the Midwest who report the books selling best in their stores. I always ask some indie booksellers I know whom I trust, like this one bookseller in Milwaukee who is always spot on.</p>
                            <h3 class="sub-heading pt-3">What Does The Future Of Literature Look Like?</h3>
                            <p class="pt-2">The future of Literature does look bright. There are many bright poets within the UK alone, including Dean Atta & Sophie Thakur. It may be the circles you hang out in. I read a lot and my circle includes both males and females who read a lot. I tend to ignore Oprah, one way or the other. Her recommendations neither incites me to buy a book nor inhibits me from the same.</p> 
                            <p>I can imagine myself having an ebook reader at some point, but sort of like in the vein of music, I'll buy an mp-3 but if I really like an album I'll get it on vinyl if available. I can envision having an ebook reader for something I know I'll read once, but not something I love. Collectively, we can ensure that the future of literacy remains bright, by contributing to clubs, pieces & blogsites all over the world. You never know who you can influence with your own words.</p>
                            <p>Pretty much, we - human beings - live in societies were we are inundated to the max with media, advertising, marketing, economic influences, social pressures, trends, blah blah blah (we started out as foragers that spent less than 4 hours a day gathering our quota of calories). Imagine that... 4 hour workdays? No wonder were now overpopulated, huh?  Anyway, this mass blast of information that comes our way, totally overloads our cognition and gives us undesirable societal problems such as mental illness and postal shootings. It also distracts us from things of the past, like great literature.  And while I don't know who oprah is, and can't knock him, I'm sure he is a product of the mass media conglomerate and the books that his club pushes are potentially wish wash that the marketing dept at penguin thinks is a great money maker no knock to you, Barrret, either. When I think 'O', I think Million Little Pieces...</p>
                            <p>So, the moral of the story is: seek out great literature in places where you wouldn't expect to find it - garage sales, basement used book stores, friends, musty professors offices, the amazing alonzo, that huge antique shop next to the Acoustic Cafe in Winona, etc..  The older, the less pop hysteria will influence you to read it for the wrong reasons.  The best book I have ever read, by far, is ranked 24,129 in sales on amazon.</p>
